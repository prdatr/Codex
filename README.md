# Codex

This repository contains a minimal prototype for an SDLC management application.
It includes:

- **Node.js/Express backend** with placeholder endpoints for configuration,
  discovery analysis, project management, coding and code review agents.
- **React frontend** served as static files, demonstrating pages for each phase
  of the software development life cycle.

## Running

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### Frontend
Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser.
